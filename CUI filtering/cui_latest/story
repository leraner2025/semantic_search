System translates nature and sub-nature terms from outside document metadata into the correct CUIs using the canonical CUI reference table and vector similarity.

Free-text strings (including multi-word, sentence fragments, and metadata labels) are evaluated for potential CUI matches.

Supports language variations including:

Synonyms

Abbreviations

Misspellings or near-match text

Hyphenation and formatting variances

Source/facility-specific taxonomy

Nested expressions (e.g., “post-op wound care instructions”)

Mapping supports complex relationships:

One term → multiple CUIs

Multiple terms → one CUI

Confidence scoring and thresholding

If no mapping meets minimum threshold, the system flags the term for manual mapping and stores it for future semantic learning.

Translated CUIs output in a standardized format consumable by downstream workflow (vector generation, clustering, search index, summarization).

The system logs:

Term processed

CUI(s) mapped

Confidence score

Method used (rule-based / vector-based / hybrid)

Version of canonical CUI table used

Historical unmapped terms can be reprocessed after new or revised CUI definitions are ingested.
