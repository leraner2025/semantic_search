Previous the capability team developed a tree-based logic to reduce the number of CUIS originally extracted from a note, so that the note can be represented by a smaller of CUIS, rather than a large number of CUIS that have overlap semantics. This story focuses on implementing this logic into a module(s) that:
Takes in a list of CUIS
Outputs a smaller list of CUIS

Dev Notes:
Maybe operate at the block level
