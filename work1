User requirements often come in descriptive formats, with multiple distinct intents embedded within a single paragraph. This initiative aims to identify these intents from a given text and convert them into actionable tasks. These tasks will then be further decomposed into specific data elements or information requirements. The extracted intents will subsequently be processed by additional logic to define their granular nature.

Consider this example: "I am analyzing patient-submitted appointment requests. Within the application, patients detail their needs and describe health concerns for diagnosis and treatment. My request is to identify and extract primary and secondary health concerns from their textual submissions."

Sample output:
Intent 1: Identify Primary Health Concerns
Description: To pinpoint the main or most urgent health issue(s) that prompted the patient's appointment request.
Requested Data/Information: The core health problem(s) the patient wishes to have diagnosed and treated, extracted from their free-text description of needs and health concerns. This would typically be a specific condition, symptom, or set of related symptoms.
Intent 2: Identify Secondary Health Concerns
Description: To find any additional health issues, symptoms, or conditions mentioned by the patient that are not the primary reason for the visit but are still relevant.
Requested Data/Information: Supplementary health problems, co-morbidities, or other symptoms described by the patient within their free-text submission that provide further context to their overall health status or appointment reason.
Natures and sub-natures of these intents are, for example: (this is not part of this story, but meant to illustrate the idea)
Intent 1: Identify Primary Health Concerns
Centrality / Main Problem
Specific Condition/Diagnosis (e.g., "strep throat," "fractured arm," "Crohn's flare")
Major Symptom(s) (e.g., "excruciating chest pain," "profuse bleeding," "sudden vision loss")
Reason for Encounter (e.g., "diagnose a new lump," "obtain treatment for infection," "check on severe pain")
Location of Concern (if specific and central, e.g., "right lower quadrant abdomen," "left shoulder")
Urgency / Severity
Descriptors of Severity (e.g., "severe," "intense," "unbearable," "significant worsening," "acute")
Acute Onset / Rapid Progression (e.g., "started suddenly," "worsened rapidly over 2 days")
Comparison to Baseline (e.g., "much worse than usual," "unlike any pain I've had before")
Direct Impact on Patient
Significant Functional Limitations (e.g., "cannot walk," "unable to work," "difficulty breathing spontaneously," "difficulty eating")
Impact on Daily Activities (e.g., "cannot perform self-care," "unable to sleep," "making it difficult to dress")
Specific Request for Intervention
Patient's Explicit Goal for Problem Resolution (e.g., "I need this treated," "I want a diagnosis for this," "Please help me manage this")
Exacerbation of Chronic Illness
Identification of Chronic Illness (e.g., "my Rheumatoid Arthritis," "my asthma," "my diabetes")
Statement of Worsening/Flare-up (e.g., "symptoms have significantly worsened," "experiencing a flare-up")
Onset/Duration of Exacerbation (e.g., "over the past three weeks," "since yesterday")
Intent 2: Identify Secondary Health Concerns
Complementary Context / Relatedness
Associated Symptoms (e.g., "also feeling fatigued," "minor nausea accompanies the headache," "some numbness in fingers")
Co-occurring Conditions (e.g., "I also have high blood pressure," "I am diabetic")
Relevant Medical History (e.g., "history of kidney stones," "had surgery last year")
Less Immediate Urgency / Background Information
Mild or Chronic Descriptors (e.g., "mild discomfort," "chronic but stable condition," "occasional symptoms")
Established Diagnoses (e.g., "diagnosed with celiac 5 years ago," "known thyroid disorder")
Duration / Stability of Condition (e.g., "been present for years and hasn't changed much")
Minor Impact on Function
Mild Functional Limitations (e.g., "sometimes makes it a little hard to concentrate," "minor inconvenience")
Quality of Life Impact (e.g., "it's annoying but not debilitating")
Patient Inquiries (Non-Primary)
Questions about Less Urgent Symptoms (e.g., "I also wanted to ask about this rash on my arm, it's not bothering me much though")
Questions about Medication Side Effects/Interactions (e.g., "is medication X interacting with Y?")
General Wellness Concerns (e.g., "can I get a check-up for my general health too?")
